# SQL Data Cleaning Project

This project demonstrates a complete data cleaning process using SQL on a real-world layoff dataset.

## ðŸ§¹ Steps Performed

1. Removed duplicates using `ROW_NUMBER()` with `PARTITION BY`
2. Standardized data entries like company names, industries, and countries
3. Handled null or blank values by updating or deleting rows
4. Converted `date` columns to proper SQL `DATE` datatype
5. Created staging tables to separate raw and cleaned data
